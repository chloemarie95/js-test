// Practice js 

/* Data types:
undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, number, and object
*/

/* Symbol = immutable, unqiue value
Object = store key value pairs */

// Variable = store and manipulate data 
/* Three ways to declare a variable: 
    - var = used throughout whole programme
    - let = only in the scope of where you declare the variable
    - const = a variable that can never change, this will cause an error
*/ 

// End all lines of code with ;

// Declaring and assigning data to variables:

var a; //declaring
var b = 2; //delcaring + assigning/initialising 

// Use console.log(variable) to check what variables are up to within different parts of your programme

/* Naming convention: camelCasing
    - e.g. newVarTest
*/

// Incrementing

var myVar = 87;

myVar = myVar + 1;

// SHORTHAND

myVar++;

// Decrementing

myVar--;

// Remainder (Modulus: %) used to detemrine if a number is even (0) or odd (1)

// SHORTHAND

b = b + 10;

b += 10; //add 10 to whatever the value of the variable was 

b = b - 5;

b -= 5;

// Single characters of a string are immutable but you can change whole strings

/* Get last letter of string:
     var[var.length - 1]
nth to last letter of string:
     var[var.length - 3]
*/

//Arrays: store several pieces of data in one place
